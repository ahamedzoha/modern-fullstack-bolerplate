## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js (optional, for running services outside Docker)
- Ngrok (optional, for tunneling)
- Certbot (optional, for SSL certificates)

### Setup

#### Method 1: Using the Setup Script

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:ahamedzoha/modern-fullstack-bolerplate.git
   cd modern-fullstack-bolerplate
   ```

2. **Run the setup script**

   ```sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   The script will guide you through the following steps:

   - Checking prerequisites
   - Gathering user input for custom domain, ngrok auth token, Clerk keys, etc.
   - Optionally generating SSL certificates with Certbot
   - Creating necessary `.env` files
   - Creating NGINX configuration
   - Building and starting the services with Docker Compose
   - Creating an `ngrok.yml` file for tunneling
   - Starting the tunnel with Ngrok

   This script will guide you through setting up the environment variables and starting the services.
   After successful setup, an `ngrok.yml` will be created with the tunneling configuration based on your `env` variables and the services will be started immediately.

3. **Start ngrok for public access** (optional) - manually start the ngrok tunnel using the following command:

   This command will create a ngrok.yml file with the tunneling configuration based on your env variables and start the tunnel.

   ```sh
   ./start_ngrok.sh
   ```

This will create a public URL that you can use to access your application from anywhere.

#### Method 2: Manual Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:ahamedzoha/modern-fullstack-bolerplate.git
    cd modern-fullstack-bolerplate
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    You need to add the environment files in 3 different locations:

    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

      ```env
      POSTGRES_USER=your_local_db_user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_local_db_password
      POSTGRES_DB=your_local_db_name
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=your_pgadmin_password
      NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
      NGROK_DOMAIN=man-xyz.ngrok-free.app
      NGROK_HOST_HEADER=xyz.ngrok-free.app
      ```

    - Create a `.env.local` file in the `fe` directory:

      ```env
      NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
      CLERK_SECRET_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
      NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
      NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
      NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/dashboard

      NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=/api
      ```

    - Create a `.env` file in the `be` directory:

      ```env
      CLERK_SECRET_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
      DB_HOST=postgres
      DB_PORT=5432
      DB_USERNAME=your_local_db_user
      DB_PASSWORD=your_local_db_password
      DB_NAME=your_local_db_name
      ```

3.  **Build and Start the Services**

    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    This command will build and start the backend, frontend, PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, and NGINX services.

4.  **Start ngrok for public access** (optional) - manually start the ngrok tunnel using the following command:

    This command will create a ngrok.yml file with the tunneling configuration based on your env variables and start the tunnel.

    ```sh
    ./start_ngrok.sh
    ```

## üîê Authentication with Clerk

This boilerplate uses **Clerk** for authentication, ensuring a seamless and secure user management experience.

- **Frontend**: Authentication is handled by Clerk's React components and hooks.
- **Backend**: Requests are authenticated using Clerk's SDK and cookie parser, ensuring secure and verified communication between frontend and backend.

### Authentication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber

    participant User
    box "Frontend" #e0f0e0
        participant Frontend as Frontend (Next.js)
        participant ClerkFrontendSDK as Clerk Frontend SDK
    end

    box "Backend" #ccf
        participant Backend as Backend (NestJS)
        participant ClerkBackendSDK as Clerk Backend SDK
        participant BackendLogic as Backend Logic
    end

    User ->> ClerkFrontendSDK: Login/Signup
    ClerkFrontendSDK ->> Frontend: Generate Token
    Frontend ->> Backend: Send Request with Token
    Backend ->> ClerkBackendSDK: Verify Token
    ClerkBackendSDK ->> BackendLogic: Validated Request
    BackendLogic ->> Frontend: Response
    Frontend ->> User: Display Data
```

### Access the Application

- **Frontend**: http://localhost
- **Backend**: http://localhost/api
- **pgAdmin**: http://localhost:5050

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings and Tips

- **Database Synchronization**: The backend is configured to synchronize the database schema on startup. **Do not use this in production** as it may lead to data loss.
- **Environment Variables**: Make sure all environment variables are correctly set in the `.env` files.
- **Port Conflicts**: Ensure the ports specified in the `docker-compose.yml` are not in use by other applications.
- **Data Persistence**: Data in PostgreSQL is persisted using Docker volumes. Make sure to back up the volumes if necessary.

## üí° Tips

- **Development**: For a smoother development experience, you can run `docker-compose up` without the `--build` flag to start the services without rebuilding the images.
- **Production**: Consider using Docker Compose override files (`docker-compose.override.yml`) to adjust settings for different environments (dev, staging, production).
- **Scaling**: For larger applications, consider using Kubernetes for orchestration.
