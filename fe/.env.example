### This is an example of the .env.local file that you should create in the fe/ directory.

# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY= 
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=

# Clerk URLs (customize if needed)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard

# Backend API
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 

# --- Additional Notes ---

# 1. Never commit this file! 
#    It contains secrets. Add it to your .gitignore.

# 2. Create a .env.local file
#    Copy the contents of this example, and fill in the actual values.

# 3. Type safety in ./src/lib/env.ts
#    As the comment suggests, create a file (or extend an existing one) to define 
#    types for your environment variables to make your code more robust.
